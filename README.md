# multiblogchromeextension

This is a sample extension which I developed to benifit the students of my college. 
Every class of a particular branch has a different blog, where all the news and study material are uploaded.
During exam times, lots of updates are made on each of the blog.
The extension customizes the new tab page of Google Chrome and it changes to a page consisting of all the section blogs.
The user can decide which blogs he wants to see.
So every time the user opens a new tab his preferred blogs are there.

I developed this extension for my branch and the four section blogs. One can change that, according to his needs.
